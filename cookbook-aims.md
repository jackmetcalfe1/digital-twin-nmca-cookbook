### Aims of the DT cookbook for NMCAs

The intentions of this cookbook are threefold. Firstly, the cookbook intends to
provide flexible guidelines around the DT concept from an NMCA perspective.
This cookbook does not intend to “define” a DT, nor does it contain any
extensive conceptual discussion of the topic. Instead, this cookbook
communicates a common understanding amongst NMCAs about what a DT
does and its components and characteristics.

This cookbook assumes that there is not a single DT concept or a single DT
implementation but rather many depending on the use case.

Secondly, this cookbook intends to provide best practice around engaging with
DTs. This cookbook is not a “how-to” guide for all aspects of DTs. It does not
contain detailed technical implementations but addresses common challenges
faced by NMCAs when engaging with DTs, both technical and non-technical.
The cookbook refers to external technical resources where appropriate. The
intention is for this cookbook to be useful to all types of NMCA and contexts in
Europe including those that are yet to engage with DTs and are still questioning
the relevance/importance of any engagement and those that are looking to
move beyond individual DT projects to enabling connected DTs.

Thirdly, and perhaps the least explicit of this cookbook’s intentions, is to provide
a call-to-action to NMCAs and the Geospatial community as a whole to engage
with and offer their experience dealing with location data to realise the value of DTs.
