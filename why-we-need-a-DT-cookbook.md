### Why we need a DT Cookbook for NMCAs

Digital Twins (DT) as a concept first emerged in 2002 during a lecture by
Michael Grieves on product life-cycle management (PLM) highlighting the
value of a bidirectional data integration between a virtual representation and a
corresponding physical system or entity (Grieves, 2002). It wasn’t until 2011
that this idea of the “conceptual ideal for PLM” was termed a “digital twin”
(Grieves, 2011). Initially, implementations of the DT concept were confined to
the manufacturing domain where efficiencies have been realised in production
systems (Liu et al., 2021). Today, however, DTs have conceptually extended
far beyond manufacturing into application domains such as engineering,
infrastructure, construction, healthcare, energy, agriculture (Batty, 2018) and,
more recently, to the idea of DTs at national and global scales to solve systemic
issues (Ellul et al., 2024). At the global scale, these issues include humaninduced
climate change (Levin et al., 2012; Simm et al., 2021), food security,
water and energy security as outlined in the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (Head, 2022). At the national scale, systemic issues include
environmental degradation, natural disaster management, responses to health
pandemics (Head, 2022) and water and forest management (Freeman, 2000;
Simm et al., 2021).

DTs have evolved from representing a single entity or system, to now
representing spaces and places whether that is cities, other urban areas or an
entire country. This shift beyond the factory floor suggests an increasing role
of Geography in DTs and poses the question: what role should Geospatial
science and its community play in Digital Twins?

Given the new application domains that DTs have now emerged in, our
understanding of what a DT is and what it does has blurred. The lack of
consensus around the components and characteristics of DTs has led to the
value of DTs being questioned and confusion amongst stakeholders about how
and whether to engage with them.

National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs) have been virtually
representing entire countries long before the concept of Digital Twins emerged.
They are key stakeholders in the Geospatial community and given their
responsibility to provide Geospatial data for entire nations, it is important there
is clarity on how they can best engage with DTs. For example, are the existing
products and services that NMCAs produce fit-for-purpose for various DT
application domains? If the answer is that there are some gaps, then what do
NMCAs need to do to achieve, and enable others to achieve, their goals or
outcomes relating to DTs?
However, NMCAs, in Europe specifically, have very different origins and, as
extensions of their respective governments, they are heavily influenced by the
country's context. NMCAs in Europe have different experiences with DTs to
date, some have not been involved in any DT projects whilst others are heavily
involved and therefore have more experience.
Given both the diversity of Twin applications and the different experiences and
interest, it can be assumed that there is no one size fits all approach to NMCA
engagement with DTs, however with few resources at all at present, there is a
need for a resource written for all NMCAs in Europe that represents a consensus on how best to engage with DTs.
