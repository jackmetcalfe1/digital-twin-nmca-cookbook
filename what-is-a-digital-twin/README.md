### Digital Twin Concepts and the NMCA perspective

This section of the repository deals with understanding the digital twin concept and what it means for NMCAs.

Start by understanding the [basic concepts](digital-twin-nmca-cookbook/what-is-a-digital-twin/the-digital-twin-concept.md). Next, get familiar with the different [components of a digital twin](digital-twin-nmca-cookbook/what-is-a-digital-twin/digital-twin-components.md), including the different geospatial aspects. 

Once you've understood the basic digital twin concept, read this section on [connected digital twins](digital-twin-nmca-cookbook/what-is-a-digital-twin/connected-digital-twins.md). 

#### What does this all mean for NMCAs?

It's all well and good understanding digital twins from a conceptual point of view but for NMCAs, and the geospatial community as a whole, digital twins may be understood slightly differently from the original definition. 

Based on a questionnaire of EuroSDR NMCA members, a [consensus on what a digital twin is for NMCAs](digital-twin-nmca-cookbook/what-is-a-digital-twin/what-is-a-digital-twin-for-NMCAs.md) is proposed.
