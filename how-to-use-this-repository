### How to use this repository effectively

It is not necessary to read this cookbook from cover to cover. The chapters deal
with individual topic areas such as the components of a DT. Each chapter has
been structured so that the beginning deals with the basics (informative), the
middle some “quick wins” (actions) and the latter some suggestions
(informative) on progressing to a more advanced level.

For readers and NMCAs that have no experience with DTs, we suggest
focusing reading on the first section of each chapter to gain a foundational
understanding of DTs. For those with some experience with DTs but perhaps
limited engagement with actual DT projects, we recommend reading the first
and middle sections of each chapter to validate that you have a foundational
understanding and to offer some quick wins relating to the topic. Finally, if you
or your organisation have extensive experience with DTs and are looking to
grow your experience, we recommend reading the whole of each chapter.
