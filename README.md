### Welcome to the Digital Twin cookbook for NMCAs. 

This repository is a collection of resources, research and discussion on how NMCAs can best engage with Digital Twins. This file covers why we need a DT cookbook for NMCAs, the intentions of this repository, the "cookbook" concept, how to use this repository and who the repository is for. 












The purpose of this cookbook is to be a living resource for NMCAs on how to engage with Digital Twins. 

Phase 1 of this project will look at the value of NMCA contributions etc. and can be found in [what is a digital twin section](what-is-a-digital-twin/README.md)
