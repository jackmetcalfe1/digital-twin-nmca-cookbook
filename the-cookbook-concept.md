### The "Cookbook" Concept

To start by stating the obvious, a cookbook is to enable cooking. It is a collection
of recipes (or instructions) to achieve a specific goal or outcome. A cookbook
is a resource that passes knowledge and guidance with a particular emphasis
on the doing and practical steps rather than just a discussion or thought piece.
Recipes in a cookbook are tried and tested and therefore are not a collection
of hypotheses or assumptions, they have been validated either by the authors
of this cookbook or by others with examples cited.

The idea of a cookbook has been used extensively outside of its principal use
case in cooking as a resource to offer practical guidance about a specific topic.
For example, cookbooks exist for writing Java (Darwin, 2008) or designing
power supplies (Brown, 2001). Closer to home in the Geospatial sphere, the
SDI cookbook (GSDI, 2012) provides guidance on how to establish Spatial Data Infrastructures in different country contexts.
