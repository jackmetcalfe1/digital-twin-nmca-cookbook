### Who is this repository for? 

This cookbook assumes a sound understanding of Geospatial Science. This
cookbook also assumes an awareness that DTs exist, however, Chapter 2
provides an introduction and overview of the DT concept from an NMCA
perspective.

The primary audience for this cookbook is NMCAs, specifically NMCAs in
Europe. While the cookbook contains recipes dealing with technical topics, this
cookbook is not a detailed implementation guide and consequently is not
necessarily written for technical teams. The focus audience within NMCAs is
product and strategy managers and, more generally, any senior decisionmaker
that has influence on the direction of the NMCAâ€™s business. However,
given the spread of topics discussed, it is likely that this cookbook is relevant
to many different roles in NMCA organisations.
